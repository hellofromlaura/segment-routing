excerpt: >-
  Segment routing is not a new concept in the networking industry and it has gained great popularity among service providers around the globe. While service providers are adopting it for the multiprotocol label switching (MPLS) data plane that is deployed extensively in existing networks, there is an increased interest to use segment routing with the IPv6 data plane for network programming (SRv6 network programming). The increased adoption of IPv6 makes it more natural to apply segment routing directly to the IPv6 data plane. There are many use cases that can benefit from the SRv6 network programming concept. Today, 5G is the main driver for fast-paced development of SRv6 standards to simplify the user plane and network plane.
