## Introduction
[P4](https://p4.org/) (named for “Programming Protocol-independent Packet Processors”) is a domain specific programming language for expressing how packets are processed by the data plane of a forwarding element such as a hardware or software switch, network interface card, router, or network appliance.
[P4](https://p4.org/) is a project hosted by the [Open Networking Foundation (ONF)](https://www.opennetworking.org/).
 
## P4 SRv6 Fabric tutorial
The [P4](https://p4.org/) SRv6 Fabric tutorial teaches you a sequence of hands-on exercises how to build an SRv6-enabled fabric using [P4](https://p4.org/), P4Runtime Agent and [Open Network Operating System (ONOS™)](https://www.opennetworking.org/onos/).<br />
The Developer/Tutorial GitHub repository is [here](https://github.com/opennetworkinglab/onos-p4-tutorial).<br />
The document with instructions can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1SmsUntwXF0RPhqvuv0oVGfAxpToOU6ytssMTlNAlb_I).
